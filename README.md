# Winning Jeopardy
In this project, I worked on [a dataset of Jeopardy questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/) 
to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help contestants efficiently study common themes and target high-valued
questions using chi-square tests.
